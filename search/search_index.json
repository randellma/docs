(mainly out of laziness and intention to migrate to Vercel where it comes for free) * The macbook air is slow for hosting a Next.js app. * Currently manually deploying when there are changes. * Multiple simultaneous discount requests are still synchronous, the request waits for the script to be free. * Discount data is locally stored on this Macbook so if it dies then so does everyone\u2019s history.</p> <p>Note: The puppeteer script cannot easily be moved out of the basement without security risk, and increased likelihood of bot detection circumventing the entire strategy.</p>"},{"location":"Wayfair%20Discount/ADR002%20-%20Message%20Broker%20Driven/#decision","title":"Decision","text":"<p>The lookup process should be managed by a message broker.
