To perform a discount check for someone you need to either find the wholesale cost and apply the calculation, or manually add the product to your cart, and apply the employee discount check. Therefore, it's tedious to check discounts for people in a timely manner and without them feeling like they are bothering me. </p>"},{"location":"Wayfair%20Discount/ADR001%20-%20Local%20Web%20App%20copy/#limitations","title":"Limitations","text":"<ul> <li>Getting wholesale price requires VPN access so it cannot be done in a hands-off automated way.</li> <li>Password sharing is not an option.</li> <li>I have friends in both US and Canada so will have to support wayfair.com and wayfair.ca</li> <li>Getting discount info requires the product to be in your Wayfair cart and manually applying the employee discount to the cart.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Wayfair%20Discount/ADR001%20-%20Local%20Web%20App%20copy/#decision","title":"Decision","text":"<p>Create a Next.js web application that will host a very basic input form for users to provide their zip/postal code and a link to a wayfair (.com or .ca) product page.
